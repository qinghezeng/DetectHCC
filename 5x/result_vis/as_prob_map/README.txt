The function to draw probability map depends on the size of WSI. So it wouldn't work if we only split part of the WSI from Visiopharm. 
Partly splitting is useful for dropping dirty or unused part out of a WSI. The main object is to calculate a optimal threshold for returning results back to Visiopharm. But using prob map is a better way so we should simply drop partly splitting.
